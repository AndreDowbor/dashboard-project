The timeline shows: 1) Name.FULL_ADDRESS changed from Rothesay, NB -&gt; 400 University Ave, Saint John, NB (2025-08-29); 2) Name.CO_ID toggled Blank -&gt; 3005 -&gt; Blank -&gt; 3005 (2025-08-29); 3) Name.CO_MEMBER_TYPE changed Blank -&gt; ORG (2025-08-29). These are profile/affiliation updates (address and organization/company id/type). Per the rules, simple profile updates (Blank -&gt; value) should be ignored for trigger selection, and none of the available engagement triggers (communication preference, conflict acknowledgement, follow-up email, donation/purchase, new join, reinstatement) match these changes. There are also no prior messages or scheduled follow-ups to de-duplicate against. Therefore there is no valid trigger to fire. Potential engagement ideas (not triggered now) include: - Send a confirmation/verification message for updated mailing address - Ask the member to confirm new organization affiliation (CO_MEMBER_TYPE = ORG) or provide organization role - Offer local chapter resources for Saint John / NB - If CO_ID stabilizes, trigger an “organizational account linked” acknowledgement If you want, I can draft suggested messages for any of these opportunities.  <https://profiles.app.datascout.ai/ccs/profile/150125> _Automated with this <https://workflow.datascout.ai/workflow/iXFyQPgJdOcKiwYK?utm_source=n8n-internal&amp;utm_medium=powered_by&amp;utm_campaign=n8n-nodes-base.slack_3e8e386698b75f3ce7ddd3f0221d4f19d8e68b8f7f008a10157eaea969e2f5b4|n8n workflow>_",

This is not a meaningful member-field change (no field moved from Blank to a non-blank value). The rules specify to ignore changes that are Blank -&gt; value; since this change is Blank -&gt; Blank, it does not correspond to any actionable engagement trigger. Additionally, there are no other changes within the 12-day window that would match triggers such as New Join (JOIN_DATE update), Made a Donation, Made a Purchase, Conflict Acknowledgement, or Reinstatement, etc. The Member Message Summary shows no messages or scheduled follow-ups, so there are no prior one-click actions or upcoming follow-ups to avoid duplicating. Therefore, no valid, unused trigger is found under the current timeline.  No_match rationale: The only timeline entry is a non-actionable Blank-&gt;Blank addition, and there are no other qualifying changes or events within the last 12 days to justify any of the eight engagement triggers.

The top changes are IsAcknowledged: False -&gt; True, DateAcknowledged: Blank -&gt; 2025-08-26 12:46:02, and HasConflict: Blank -&gt; False — these exactly match the Conflict of Interest Acknowledgement trigger (DateAcknowledged filled and IsAcknowledged = True). However, the member already received a conflict_acknowledgement message on 2025-08-27 (Message 1 in the Member Message Summary) with a one-click response clicked, so sending that trigger again would violate the de-duplication rule. I therefore skipped those changes. I then evaluated CanVote (Blank -&gt; False) — there is no matching engagement trigger for voting changes in the provided trigger list — and Name.TITLE (value -&gt; Blank), which is a profile change but not a Blank-&gt;value update and does not map to any available trigger. No other timeline changes within the 12-day window map to an unused trigger.   Suggestions to avoid losing engagement opportunities (examples): - CanVote set to False (2025-08-26): consider a tailored message explaining voting eligibility and how to update voting status or member type if eligible (evidence: CanVote change).  - Title removed (2025-08-26): consider a confirm-contact-details prompt since tags show several byaiagent-confirm-contact-details entries (evidence: Name.TITLE change + recent tag activity).  - Tags show many byaiagent-event-interest and byaiagent-needs-info created today/1 day ago — consider a targeted follow-up asking which events/topics they’re interested in or what info they need (evidence: multiple new tags).  <https://profiles.app.datascout.ai/ccs/profile/135698> _Automated with this <https://workflow.datascout.ai/workflow/iXFyQPgJdOcKiwYK?utm_source=n8n-internal&amp;utm_medium=powered_by&amp;utm_campaign=n8n-nodes-base.slack_3e8e386698b75f3ce7ddd3f0221d4f19d8e68b8f7f008a10157eaea969e2f5b4|n8n workflow>_",

The Member Message Summary shows no prior messages or scheduled follow-ups, so de-duplication is not an issue, but there is no valid trigger to fire.  Potential engagement ideas (not selected as triggers because they are not automatic rules but could be useful): - Ask for clarification about the new \"SignificantFinancialInterest\" value (e.g., \"Thanks for updating your profile — can you confirm whether you have any significant financial interests to declare?\"). - Follow-up to verify the new free-text fields (Mitigation / Relates) — a short ask asking if they need help updating profile details. - General profile-completion nudge (if many fields remain blank) or a targeted message thanking for profile updates.

However, the member already received a conflict_acknowledgement message on 2025-08-22 (Message 1 in the Member Message Summary), so firing the same trigger would violate the de-duplication rule. The only other recent change within 12 days is a misc activity on 2025-08-19 labeled “CCS Staff,” which does not map to any of the available engagement triggers. Changes on 2025-08-13 are 15 days old and therefore excluded. Because the COI trigger is already used and there are no other matching, unused triggers for changes within the 12-day window, I return no_match.  Suggested opportunities (examples) based on the timeline that could be considered by product/marketing teams: - Committee appointment acknowledgment (for the 2025-08-19 “CCS Staff” activity): short note congratulating on committee role and linking to committee resources/onboarding. Example subject: \"Welcome to the CCS Committee — Resources &amp; Next Steps.\"  - If the COI acknowledgement wasn’t formally thanked: a one-time thank-you (distinct from the feedback request already sent) — only if not already sent elsewhere. - Offer committee onboarding or resource links for staff with active committee terms (use committee term data rather than the misc activity event).  I avoided selecting conflict_acknowledgement because Message 1 (2025-08-22) already sent that follow-up.

This change does not map to any Engagement Trigger (no change in Chapter/Network, Employer, Address, City, Country, CPD, etc.; it appears to be an internal document upload event). Subsequent changes on the same date are duplicates. Cross-referencing with the Member Message Summary shows a previously sent trigger for New Join on 2025-08-07 (Action Code: new_join); that trigger cannot be reused. Therefore no valid, unused trigger matches the observed timeline.

CJC_Online changed False -&gt; True (2025-08-14) and COICollection and COIDisclosureCategories changed False -&gt; True (2025-08-14).

Potential engagement ideas to consider (retain for future if new/allowed changes occur): - If CJC_Online was toggled recently: send a brief confirmation/welcome to CJC Online and explain benefits. - If COI submission is confirmed with a date: send a thank-you and short note about next steps (map to conflict_acknowledgement). - If Title/profile updated recently: a brief profile-confirmation message (optional, low-priority). Examples: - “Thanks — we’ve received your COI disclosure on {date}. No further action is needed.” - “You’re now enrolled in CJC Online.

None map to any Engagement Trigger (no change in Employer/Address/etc., and no explicit trigger like New Join, Registered for Event, etc.).

Can we help you find events or resources in Mississauga?\" \n- \"Help us complete your profile: add a title and chapter to get tailored updates.\"",
